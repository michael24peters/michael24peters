My name is Michael Peters. I received a degree in Engineering Physics from The Ohio State University (it was about half physics, half computer science and engineering).

I'm now working on my PhD in Physics at the University of Cincinnati, dividing my time between a high-energy physics analysis and a new long-lived particle (dark matter) detector at CERN: CODEX-b.
